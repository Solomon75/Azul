# Azul : Reinvented
With my associate, Medine, we embarked on a mission to make Azul fun (and pretty) again. 
The whole project will be made entirely in Java. This very Readme shall be modified as 
the project advances and some instructions, as well as some thoughts (or jokes maybe ?)
will be added in. Stay tuned, for the best looking Azul game you've ever seen.
